I am a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor <a href='https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/' target="_blank">Mark Dredze</a> at the <a href='https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/' target="_blank">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> at <a href='https://www.jhu.edu/' target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>.

## Research 

My research involves developing NLP and machine learning models for inferences over social media. I am particularly interested in methods to build these models for low-resource domains and languages. I am also interested in work on using machine learning and data science for applications with a positive personal, social or humanitarian impact. My work has been driven by real-world problems with an emphasis on applications for the social sciences and public health sciences.

I developed Twitter sentiment analysis models for journalists to gauge [public reactions](https://www.publico.pt/2013/03/28/tecnologia/noticia/gostar-culpar-e-mentira-foram-as-palavras-mais-repetidas-nos-tweets-com-mencoes-a-socrates-1589478) to newsworthy events. I also developed models for a political opinion mining system to track the popularity and attitudes about Portuguese politicians on social media, over time. The indicators produced by the system were made [publicly available](http://www.popstar.pt) and have been used by political scientists such as [Pedro Magalhães](http://www.pedro-magalhaes.org/) to conduct [analyses](http://www.popstar.pt/wp/) about public opinion.

I developed neural representation learning models that can capture latent personal traits of social media users from their prior posting history. I used these learned user representations to develop novel [sarcasm detection](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/this-neural-network-tries-to-tell-if-youre-being-sarcastic-online/) models.

**Public Health**

I leveraged the same user representations to build classifiers to predict if a user is affected by a mental illness, such as depression or PTSD, given their Twitter data.

Currently, I am applying these models to build digital epidemiology systems to support real-time and longitudinal large-scale public health studies from social media data with strong emphasis on behavioral health. My hope is that this work will foster a better understanding of behavioral disorders and how they affect different segments of the population, thereby improving clinical practices; enable more responsive and deliberate public health interventions; and ultimately bring about a platform for [precision public health](https://blogs.cdc.gov/genomics/2018/05/15/precision-public-health-2/).
